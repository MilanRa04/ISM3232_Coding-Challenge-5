Create a customer order management system
In this challenge, you will create a simple system to manage customer orders for a small coffee shop. The system will track customer orders, calculate the total amount due for each order, check the status of orders, and manage inventory for the coffee shop. Youâ€™ll use objects to represent orders and products, arrays to store multiple orders, and array/object methods to manipulate the data.
